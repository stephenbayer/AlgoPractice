Algo Practice
---

Creating Data structures and algorithms from scratch using only primatives, arrays and previously created data structures (ie.  If I create a Linked List class, later on I can use the linked list class in an implementation of a dynamic addressing hash table). 

I'm allowed to only use the definitions of a data structure or algorithm, and implement it how I feel it would be implemented.  Not necessarily correct, but completely from the concepts I know and not use any implementation available outside my own mind. 

Also, I'd like to create a desktop impelementation that uses these classes and implementations some how.  I don't know how yet, but in a way that illustrates the functionality I create. 

And so it begins:
